# WSB-Insights-Dashboard

**Ideas for this project:**   
    - gets WSB top sentiment API ticker symbols  
    - gets current stock price for each ticker (using a TDB stock market API)  
    - show ticker market cap, other info about the company (founded date, industry, etc)  
    - gets stock price for 1 month(and/or week?) ago, gives difference between current and 1 mon(and/or week) ago  
    - get top news stories (from a news API) related to each ticker and offers them  
    - use openai api to get a short description of the company  
    - shows what $n invested one month(and/or week) ago would be worth today?  
    - also show some sort of options interest?  
    - also show volume?
