# Wall Street Bets Insights Dashboard

**Ideas for this project:**   
- gets WSB top sentiment API ticker symbols  
- gets current stock price for each ticker (using a TDB stock market API)  
- show ticker market cap, other info about the company (founded date, industry, etc)  
- gets stock price for 1 month(and/or week?) ago, gives difference between current and 1 mon(and/or week) ago  
- get top news stories (from a news API) related to each ticker and offers them  
- use openai api to get a short description of the company  
- shows what $n invested one month(and/or week) ago would be worth today?  
- also show some sort of options interest?  
- also show volume?
